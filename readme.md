# AOC 2023
For the joy of coding.

## Day 1
This was interesting. 

Part 1 - the challenge here was a single line can contain only a single number, handling that was the trick imo.

Part 2 - did not do but I'm assuming need to do a form of sliding window to parse out the numbers and then do the same apporach to part 1.
